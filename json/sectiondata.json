Each covered entity will receive a &ldquo;Monthly 340B Utilizaiton File&rdquo; in Excel format. This file will contain all drug claims when billed at the point of service (POS) level or if the UD modifier was billed for physician administered outpatient drugs. It does exclude all drug claims in which VT Medicaid is not the primary payer.<br \/>\r\n2. Covered entity indicates which claims are eligible for 340B pricing. 3. For those that are eligible the Covered entity indicates the 340B Acquisition cost as of the date of service.<br \/>\r\n4. The Covered Entity will then return File back to DXC.<br \/>\r\n5. DXC calculates the refund needed to Medicaid based on the acquisition cost as compared to the Medicaid paid amount.<br \/>\r\n6. Payment is due 30 days of invoice mailing.<\/p>","source":"<p>340B Drug Discount Program Provider Manual &ndash; June
